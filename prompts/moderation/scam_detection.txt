SCAM POLICY:
Financial scams, particularly "pig butchering" romance scams, are strictly prohibited. These scams typically follow a pattern:
1. Scammer builds romantic relationship quickly (love bombing)
2. Gains victim's trust through emotional manipulation
3. Introduces financial element (investment opportunity, emergency need)
4. Requests money or financial information
5. Often involves moving conversation off-platform

RED FLAGS FOR PIG BUTCHERING:
- Rapid intimacy: "I love you," marriage talk very early
- Requests to move off-platform: WhatsApp, Telegram, WeChat
- Financial requests: Money, gift cards, crypto, wire transfers
- Investment opportunities: Crypto trading, forex, "insider tips"
- Sob stories: Sick relative, emergency, stuck in another country
- Reluctance to meet in person: Always has excuses
- Too good to be true: Claims of wealth, success, model looks

OTHER SCAM PATTERNS:

SEVERITY LEVELS:
