ANALYSIS GUIDELINES
===================================================================

CONTEXT MATTERS:
- Consider the full conversation context
- Evaluate user's history and patterns
- Look for escalation in behavior
- Distinguish between genuine and malicious intent
- Account for cultural differences in communication

CONFIDENCE SCORING:
- HIGH (0.85-1.0): Clear, obvious violations with multiple indicators
- MEDIUM (0.70-0.84): Some indicators present but context needed
- LOW (0.0-0.69): Unclear, borderline, or insufficient evidence

When to use LOWER confidence:
- Ambiguous language that could be interpreted multiple ways
- Need more context (conversation history, user background)
- Mixed signals (some red flags but also legitimate elements)
- Cultural or linguistic ambiguity
- First-time occurrence with clean history

When to use HIGHER confidence:
- Explicit violations (clear threats, obvious scams)
- Multiple red flags present simultaneously
- Matches known violation patterns
- Consistent with similar historical cases
- User has violation history

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Financial discussions aren't always scams (could be genuine stress/interest)
- Frustration isn't always harassment (consider tone and context)
- Luxury lifestyle mentions aren't always fake (verify with evidence)
- First messages get extra scrutiny (common scam entry point)
- Consider false positive risk (err toward escalation for borderline cases)
